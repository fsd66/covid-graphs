# Covid Graphs

Utility that pulls data from [NY Times' github](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), and creates a graph of each state in the dataset.
Made it because I wanted to see a state by state breakdown of COVID-19 cases to see how different each curve would be.

Usage:

```bash
python3 covid_graph.py

# or if you want log scaled graphs

python3 covid_graph.py --log
```
